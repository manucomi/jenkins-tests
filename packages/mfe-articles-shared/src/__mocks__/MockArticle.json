        "content": "<p>In 2009, when Fisher-Price debuted the Rock &#8217;n Play Sleeper &#8212; a portable, soothing bassinet-like device for infants &#8212; Fisher-Price and its parent company, Mattel, were under pressure to reverse what had been an ongoing decline of their stock price. The Rock &#8217;n Play was a success: By 2019, Fisher-Price had sold 4.7 million of them, more than <a href=\"https:\/\/thewirecutter.com\/blog\/fisher-price-rock-n-play-recall\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one for every 10 babies born in the United States since the launch<\/a>.<\/p> <p>Today we know that this success came with a high price: Since 2009, the Fisher-Price Rock &#8217;n Play Sleeper has been linked to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/recalls\/fisher-price-rock-n-play-sleeper-should-be-recalled-consumer-reports-says\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">32 infant deaths<\/a>. Initially, Fisher-Price argued that the deaths occurred because parents failed to properly strap infants into the sleeper. But on April 5, 2019, approximately four years after the first death that regulators eventually linked to the product, Fisher-Price joined with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission <a href=\"https:\/\/www.prnewswire.com\/news-releases\/media-statement-on-the-us-consumer-product-safety-commission-fisher-price-joint-security-alert-released-on-april-5-2019-300825554.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to issue a warning<\/a> that the sleeper should not be used with children who could already roll over. In an attempt to pacify customers, the company issued a statement, saying, &#8220;Generations of parents have trusted us for almost 90 years to provide safe products for their children.&#8230;Fisher-Price and every one of our employees take the responsibility of being part of your family seriously, and we are committed to earning that trust every day.&#8221; On April 12, after more pressure from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aap.org\/en-us\/about-the-aap\/aap-press-room\/Pages\/AAP-Urges-U-S-Consumer-Product-Safety-Commission-to-Recall-Fisher-Price-Rock-n-Play-Sleeper.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Academy of Pediatrics<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.consumerreports.org\/media-room\/press-releases\/2019\/04\/consumer-reports-fisher-price-must-recall-the-rock-n-play-sleeper-immediately\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consumer Reports<\/a>, Fisher-Price finally <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpsc.gov\/Recalls\/2019\/fisher-price-recalls-rock-n-play-sleepers-due-to-reports-of-deaths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">issued a total recall of the product<\/a>.<\/p> <hbr-component type=\"newsletter\" name=\"The Big Idea\" \/> <p>Analysts with UBS estimate that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/mattels-fisher-price-recall-of-item-tied-to-infant-deaths-could-cost-40-million-to-60-million-2019-04-15\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recall will cost<\/a> Mattel between $40 million and $60 million. But these kinds of estimates rarely calculate the long-term cost associated with the loss of stakeholder trust. When a company fails to live up to the basic expectation of trustworthiness &#8212; when they lack competence, integrity, or benevolence, for example &#8212; stakeholders feel betrayed. This feeling of betrayal often leads customers to mistrust the company&#8217;s actions in the future. In the Fisher-Price case, parents are likely to question the company&#8217;s competence in developing safe products and may doubt the integrity of its communication about safety risks.<\/p> <p><a href=\"https:\/\/sloanreview.mit.edu\/article\/designing-trustworthy-organizations\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">My research<\/a> shows that trust violations like Fisher-Price&#8217;s are not usually the result of rogue employees or a one-time problem at the company. Rather, they are frequently caused by company-wide pressures to grow and innovate. In order to understand why growth can lead to trust violations, and how you can identify whether it&#8217;s happening in your own company, you need to first understand <em>when<\/em> innovation becomes reckless &#8212; and how to identify signs of organizational drift, which can lead to disaster.<\/p> <h2>How Manic Innovation Works<\/h2> <p>Manic innovation occurs when companies fail to balance growth with risk management. It relieves constraints and speeds along the innovation process while transferring or increasing risks to stakeholders. There are signs of this in the Rock &#8217;n Play debacle. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/economy\/how-fisher-price-invented-a-popular-baby-sleeper-without-safety-tests-and-kept-it-on-the-market-even-as-babies-died\/2019\/05\/30\/78c2707a-7731-11e9-b3f5-5673edf2d127_story.html?utm_term=.c99a569fdb46\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fisher-Price researched<\/a> the infant-gear market and saw the need for an infant sleep device that would help sleep-deprived parents. But in the search for a hit product, the company innovated by rethinking infant sleep while ignoring key safety controls in a number of ways: violating guidelines for safe sleep set by the American Academy of Pediatrics; asking the Consumer Product Safety Commission for an exemption from its bassinet and cradle specifications; and marketing the Rock &#8217;n Play, through pictures and statements, as a device an infant could sleep in all night long.<\/p> <p>Because the multiple lawsuits are ongoing, there&#8217;s still much we don&#8217;t know about how this faulty process operated. But as in many other cases&#8212;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/money\/cars\/2017\/10\/20\/gm-settles-deadly-ignition-switch-cases-120-million\/777831001\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GM&#8217;s ignition switch<\/a> problem, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hbs.edu\/faculty\/Pages\/item.aspx?num=43888\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Barclay&#8217;s LIBOR scandal<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/business\/archive\/2014\/07\/citibank-will-pay-7-billion-over-mortgage-crisis\/374154\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Citibank&#8217;s subprime mortgage<\/a> disaster, and Facebook&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/11\/14\/technology\/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">fake news complicity<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2019\/04\/24\/716886822\/facebook-could-face-up-to-5-billion-fine-for-privacy-violations\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">privacy violations<\/a>&#8212;manic innovation was allowed to continue because the forces concerned about risk and long-term reputation were systematically marginalized within the company. <\/p> <h2>Controlling Organizational Drift in the Innovation Process<\/h2> <p>In order to see how this marginalization happens, we need to understand the process of organizational drift. This term refers to the slow and gradual evolution of the way in which the organization functions &#8212; strategy, culture, processes, governance, and so on &#8212; to attempt to reach goals that cannot be achieved through normal and legitimate means. As this occurs, risk management and compliance officers are not able to temper the push to take new products to market. As a result, some stakeholders (e.g., executives in the bonus pool) receive benefits at the expense of others.<\/p> <p>In companies where this happens, rather than having to take into consideration any control functions &#8212; such as legal, compliance, and risk reviews &#8212; innovators are shielded from them. At the same time, those innovators are rewarded for moving quickly. As the risk management and compliance functions fade into the background, a rogue subculture gradually comes to dominate the enterprise. This subculture celebrates goal achievement, rewards team players that go along, and punishes any &#8220;non-cooperators&#8221; whose concern for risk is making achieving goals more challenging. Organization leaders only realize how far the company has drifted when this unsustainable process crashes.<\/p> <p>When I work with compliance professionals who want to do more to protect their companies from organizational drift, I ask some key questions about the early-warning signs. The first set speak to the conditions that can cause organizational drift; the second involve common signs that drift is already happening. Organizations can use them to help avoid potentially disastrous trust violations.<\/p> <article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar\"><div class=\"sidebar-contents\"> <div class=\"mbm pbm mtm ptn pln mln has-no-bg mln pln man pan\" style=\"padding:none;margin:none;padding-left:none;margin-left:none;\"> <table width=\"100%\" border=\"0\" class=\"has-no-border\" data-image-representation-uri=\"http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/When-Innovation-and-Trust-Are-at-Odds_Tbl1_Identifying-Potential-for-Org-Drift.png\"> <tbody> <tr class=\"has-no-bg\"> <td class=\"has-no-bg\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left:0rem;font-size: 1.5rem;\"> <h2 style=\"margin-left: .5rem;padding: 0;width:100%\">Identifying the Potential for Organizational Drift<\/h2> <\/td> <\/tr> <tr class=\"has-no-bg\"> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom has-border-right uppercase\"><strong>Underlying Cause<\/strong><\/td> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom uppercase\"><strong>Diagnostic Questions<\/strong><\/td> <\/tr> <tr class=\"has-no-bg\"> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom has-border-right\">Sales, profit, expense, stock price pressure&#160;<\/td> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom\">Is the pressure to achieve goals unreasonable and fear inducing?<\/td> <\/tr> <tr class=\"has-no-bg\"> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom has-border-right\">Speed, time, deadline pressure<\/td> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom\">Can people take the time to do things right?<\/td> <\/tr> <tr class=\"has-no-bg\"> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom has-border-right\">Short-term goals<\/td> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom\">Do short-term goals trump long-term goals?<\/td> <\/tr> <tr class=\"has-no-bg\"> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom has-border-right pbm\">New management<\/td> <td class=\"has-no-bg has-border-bottom pbm\">Is management stable?

Instead it&#8217;s to engage and collaborate with the organization&#8217;s control functions to make sure that the innovation process does not go off the rails. Innovators and risk managers need to work together, early and often, and they need to keep constant watch for organizational drift. Working together, they are better able to achieve rapid &#8212; but not manic &#8212; innovation.<\/p> <p>While this may sound good in theory, in practice it is hard to achieve. Innovators and people in control functions (e.g., risk managers, compliance, legal, and internal audit) think differently and often have conflicting incentives. Some managers in control functions think they are only in the risk-prevention business; in truth, they need to be rewarded when they help find ways to encourage innovation safely. In fact, <a href=\"http:\/\/tehcpa.net\/risk-management\/managing-risks-and-enabling-growth-in-the-age-of-innovation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PwC&#8217;s 2018 Risk in Review<\/a> study found that risk managers who were more involved throughout the innovation cycle &#8212; proactively adjusting risk appetite, sharing risks, working more closely with innovators, and expanding continuous risk assessment &#8212; were better able to manage risk exposure.<\/p> <p>But change is also required on the part of the innovators, who must be taught to see risk management hurdles as important and legitimate, rather than as bureaucratic commands from the growth-prevention departments. Managing the balance between innovation and control requires more sophisticated innovators and control personnel who can deal with these tensions without retreating to simplifications that ignore either growth or risk. For example, according to a senior compliance manager at Google, the company is endeavoring to improve collaboration between innovators and compliance personnel, and is also experimenting with addressing potential risks earlier in the innovation process.<\/p> <p>When innovation is done well, companies manage both growth and compliance to sustain innovation and company reputation. Consider an example where Chase Bank got it right. Chase was one of the first financial institutions in the 1990s to experiment with derivatives to create synthetic mortgage instruments. While Citibank and Merrill Lynch grew explosively in the early 2000s using these instruments, Chase took a go-slow approach, combining innovation with good risk management. Through this process, the bank determined that it couldn&#8217;t manage the downside risks of the instruments, and decided to limit its exposure, effectively managing the need to balance the growth of new products and processes with controls to manage risk and stability. Had Fisher-Price followed their example, they could have avoided the unfortunate situation in which they find themselves now.<span class=\"mlm plm has-border-left uppercase font-national-compressed font-bold font-size-default text-gray-light spacing-wide\">The<\/span><span class=\"uppercase font-national-compressed font-bold font-size-default text-gray-dark spacing-wide\"> Big Idea<\/span><\/p>",

        "summary": "Companies don&#8217;t win over investors just by issuing sustainability reports and engaging in other standard ESG practices. What they need to do, says Harvard Business School&#8217;s George Serafeim, is integrate ESG efforts into strategy and operations. He makes five recommendations: Identify the material issues in your industry and develop initiatives that set your firm apart from rivals; create accountability mechanisms to ensure the board&#8217;s commitment; infuse the whole organization with a sense of purpose and enthusiasm for sustainability and good governance; decentralize ESG activities throughout your operations; and communicate regularly and transparently with investors about ESG matters.\nThe Board&#8217;s Role in Sustainability\nTo build long-term profitability, boards of directors must pay more attention to ESG concerns&#8212;and a compelling corporate purpose should underpin their efforts. That&#8217;s the contention of the authors, who offer a research-based framework called SCORE to guide boards&#8217; actions: Simplify&#8212;define and communicate your purpose clearly; Connect&#8212;link your purpose to strategy and capital allocation decisions; Own&#8212;ensure that all employees embrace the firm&#8217;s mission and have the means to deliver on it; Reward&#8212;tie executive compensation to metrics that include ESG performance; Exemplify&#8212;use data and narrative accounts to show stakeholders how you&#8217;re achieving your purpose and improving sustainability.\nThe Challenge of Rating ESG Performance\nOver the past decade, more and more institutional investors have taken an interest in companies&#8217; records on environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and governance. In this article the head of ESG research at Sustainalytics, which gathers information on tens of thousands of companies worldwide, explains why this data matters and how his firm arrives at its performance ratings. The process involves identifying the risks a company faces, assessing how well it&#8217;s managing them, and engaging in follow-up dialogue to ensure accurate analysis. MacMahon also discusses why certain companies&#8217; ratings have improved or worsened and how to put your best foot forward.\nThe complete Spotlight package is available in a single reprint.",

Yet their firms aren&#8217;t being rewarded by capital markets.<\/p> <p class=\"hed\">The Insight<\/p> <p>Following the crowd on ESG activities is not the answer. To gain a competitive advantage, firms should instead focus on the ESG issues that are financially material for them and pursue those in distinctive ways.<\/p> <p class=\"hed\">The Actions<\/p> <p>Management should take five steps: Adopt strategic ESG practices; create accountability structures for ESG integration; identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it; make operational changes to ensure that the ESG strategy is successfully executed; and commit to transparency and relationship building with investors.<\/p> <\/div><\/article-ideainbrief> <p>Until the mid-2010s few investors paid attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data&#8212;information about companies&#8217; carbon footprints, labor policies, board makeup, and so forth. Today the data is widely used by investors. Some screen out poor ESG performers, assuming that the factors that cause companies to receive low ESG ratings will result in weak financial results. Some seek out high ESG performers, expecting exemplary ESG behaviors to drive superior financial results, or wishing, for ethical reasons, to invest only in &#8220;green funds.&#8221; Other investors incorporate ESG data into fundamental analysis. And some use the data as activists, investing and then urging companies to clean up their acts.<\/p> <p>It&#8217;s an open question whether ESG issues will remain as salient to investors during a global pandemic and the associated economic downturn&#8212;but my bet is that they will. That&#8217;s because companies are likely to be more resilient in the face of unexpected shocks and hardships if they are managed for the long term and in line with societal megatrends, such as inclusion and climate change. Indeed, in the opening weeks of global bear markets following the spread of Covid-19, most ESG funds outperformed their benchmarks. And when colleagues and I looked at data for more than 3,000 firms between late February and late March 2020&#8212;when global financial markets were collapsing&#8212;we found that the ones the public perceived as behaving more responsibly had less-negative stock returns than their competitors. I believe that longer term, the crisis is likely to increase awareness that companies must consider societal needs, not just short-term profits. The recent prominence of the Black Lives Matter movement, too, is creating a groundswell of support for strong diversity policies and fair employment practices. It seems clear that companies will be under growing pressure to improve their performance on ESG dimensions in the future.<\/p> <p><a name=\"reprint\"><\/a><\/p> <article-sidebar class=\"article-sidebar sidebar--right\"><h4 class=\"sidebar-title\">Making Sustainability Count: Series reprint<\/h4><div class=\"sidebar-contents\"><p><a href=\"\/download\/subscriber\/reprint\/R2005B-PDF-ENG\" class=\"dcsReprint__link--download hide-for-non-subscriber\"><i class=\"icon icon-download-pdf prs\"><\/i>download PDF<\/a><br \/> <a href=\"https:\/\/store.hbr.org\/product\/making-sustainability-count\/r2005b?sku=R2005B-PDF-ENG\" class=\"dcsReprint__link--buy\"><i class=\"icon icon-buy-copies prs\"><\/i>buy copies<\/a><\/p> <\/div><\/article-sidebar> <p>The challenge for many corporate leaders is that they aren&#8217;t sure how to do that. They lack understanding of exactly where they should be focusing their attention and how they should be communicating their ESG efforts. Many executives incorrectly believe that simple actions will suffice: improving ESG disclosures, releasing a sustainability report, or holding a sustainability-focused investor relations event. Some companies take those actions, fail to see a benefit, and grow disappointed or frustrated. In some cases they face criticism and negative reactions from investors.<\/p> <p>It&#8217;s easy to see why this has happened. Too many companies have embraced a &#8220;box-ticking&#8221; culture that encourages the adoption of increasingly standardized ESG activities, many of them created by analysts and consultants who rely on industry benchmarks and best practices. Those activities may well be good for society and the bottom line. Firms reap clear benefits in the form of operational efficiencies: After all, ESG measures such as reducing waste, strengthening relationships with external stakeholders, and improving risk management and compliance are good business hygiene. In many industries such efforts are now table stakes for enterprises wishing to remain competitive.<\/p> <p>But they&#8217;re not enough. Companies must move beyond box checking and window dressing. In a world that increasingly judges them on their ESG performance, they must look to more-fundamental drivers&#8212;particularly strategy&#8212;to achieve real results and be rewarded for them. Over the past two decades various colleagues and I have analyzed more than 10,000 companies, conducting 30 field studies and publishing more than 15 empirical papers. Our collective research points to the need for a new management paradigm for corporate leaders&#8212;one in which ESG considerations are embedded in both strategy and operations.<\/p> <p>In this article I describe a five-pronged approach to help companies achieve superior performance through attention to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and good governance. Pursuing this work isn&#8217;t about ESG ratings per se&#8212;it&#8217;s about using ESG integration to create new forms of competitive advantage. And since it involves fundamental strategic and operational choices, it can&#8217;t be left entirely to the investor relations team or the sustainability department. Instead it must be a priority for the CEO and top executives and become central to the firm&#8217;s culture.<\/p> <h2>Why ESG Issues Matter<\/h2> <p>The most fundamental reason to try to raise your company&#8217;s ESG performance is that all human beings&#8212;in and out of corporate settings&#8212;have an obligation to behave in prosocial ways. But apart from the moral case, there are very real payoffs for focusing on ESG issues. And those extend beyond the benefits companies might enjoy because of productivity increases due to higher employee engagement, or sales increases due to more loyal and satisfied customers.<\/p> <p>First, an ESG focus can help management reduce capital costs and improve the firm&#8217;s valuation. That&#8217;s because as more investors look to put money into companies with stronger ESG performance, larger pools of capital will be available to those companies. My research colleagues and I have found this happening not only in equity markets but also in loan markets, where some banks are linking interest rates on loans to ESG performance. ING, for example, did just that in 2017 when it made a $1.2 billion loan to Philips, an innovator in health technology and consumer products.<\/p> <p>Second, positive action and transparency on ESG matters can help companies protect their valuations as more global regulators and governments mandate ESG disclosures. My research with Jody Grewal of the University of Toronto and Edward Riedl of Boston University showed that after the European Union announced broader disclosure requirements, the stock market reacted positively to firms with strong ESG disclosure and negatively to those with weak disclosure. And it&#8217;s not only developed countries that are adopting and enforcing disclosure regulations; so are many emerging markets, including South Africa, Brazil, India, and China.<\/p> <div class=\"article-callout\"><div class=\"callout-contents\"><p><span class=\"callout\">Many companies incorrectly believe that simple ESG actions will suffice.<\/span><\/p> <\/div><\/div> <p>Third, efforts to ensure sustainable practices will help maintain shareholder satisfaction with board leadership. As more investors with more assets under management commit to ESG investing, they will have more voting power to effect changes. Shareholders in a growing number of companies have already put forward proposals to improve gender diversity on the boards, garnering a level of support that was unimaginable even 10 years ago. For example, nearly 63% of voting shareholders at Cognex, a maker of machine vision products, approved a proposal to diversify the board, while a similar measure at the real estate company Hudson Pacific Properties received 85% support. To avoid votes against directors, challenges to executive-pay initiatives, and the like, management needs to be proactive about addressing ESG issues.<\/p> <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, ESG practices are part of long-term strategy, and every company needs investors who support management&#8217;s vision and plans for the future. When Paul Polman became the CEO of Unilever, then an underperforming consumer goods giant, he immediately ended quarterly earnings guidance and was explicit about his commitment to long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. That led to an exodus of short-term-focused investors, thereby attracting more-patient capital.<\/p> <p>So how can companies get ahead of the trends and realize tangible financial benefits from their ESG programs? In my experience studying and advising companies with strong programs, I have identified five actions that management can take: Adopt strategic ESG practices; create accountability structures for ESG integration; identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it; make operational changes to ensure that the ESG strategy is successfully executed; and commit to transparency and relationship building with investors.<\/p> <h2>A Strategic ESG Program<\/h2> <p>To date, most companies have been treating ESG efforts like a cell phone case&#8212;something added for protection (in this case, protection of the firm&#8217;s reputation). Corporate leaders need to replace this mentality with an ambitious and differentiated ESG strategy if they want to see real financial dividends.<\/p> <p>In his seminal article &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www1.qa.hbr.org\/1996\/11\/what-is-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Is Strategy?<\/a>&#8221; (HBR, November&#8211;December 1996), Michael Porter draws a distinction between operational effectiveness and strategy. The former, he writes, &#8220;means performing similar activities better than rivals&#8221;; the latter &#8220;is about being different.&#8221; Following Porter&#8217;s distinction, an ESG program may deliver efficiencies and other operational improvements&#8212;maybe even some that are necessary for corporate survival&#8212;but it will boost long-term financial performance only if it provides strategic differentiation from competitors.<\/p> <p>For example, some companies implement environmental-, water-, or waste-management systems in order to operate more efficiently. Although such systems would be included in ESG ratings, few if any companies would expect to establish a competitive advantage simply by adopting them. Typically, competitors can quickly follow suit and acquire similar systems. My research with Ioannis Ioannou of London Business School suggests that this is indeed what has happened. Analyzing data from close to 4,000 companies globally, we found that within most industries, ESG practices converged over the eight years from 2012 through 2019. In other words, firms are increasingly engaging in the same sorts of sustainability and governance activities&#8212;and thus failing to differentiate themselves strategically.<\/p> <p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-269683 mbn pbn\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-1024x576.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-500x281.jpg 500w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-383x215.jpg 383w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-700x394.jpg 700w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A-850x478.jpg 850w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_A.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" \/><span class=\"credit line-height-tight\">Marlies Plank<\/span><\/p> <p>To outperform their competitors, companies need to find approaches that are more difficult to imitate. In our study we identified the ESG activities in each industry that have become widespread, which we termed <em>common<\/em> practices, and those that have not, which we termed <em>strategic.<\/em> As an example of the latter, think of Airbnb&#8217;s creation of a peer-to-peer network and a &#8220;circular economy&#8221; business model (one involving the reuse of existing assets), or Google&#8217;s unconventional approach to employee recruitment, engagement, and retention. Those distinctive practices have helped Airbnb and Google occupy competitive positions that cannot be easily replicated&#8212;and the companies have been rewarded by capital markets as a result. Indeed, our research confirms that the adoption of strategic ESG practices is significantly and positively associated with both return on capital and market valuation multiples, even after accounting for a firm&#8217;s past financial performance.<\/p> <p>So how can companies identify strategic ESG initiatives? As with any strategy, the way to start is by determining where to play and how to win. The former is particularly vital because not all ESG issues are created equal&#8212;some matter more, depending on the industry. In the energy and transportation sectors, for instance, investing to make the transition to a low-carbon economy is becoming increasingly important, affecting companies&#8217; costs and margins. In the technology sector, however, carbon-footprint reduction is not as relevant as building a diverse organization, which can bolster a brand&#8217;s reputation and lead to increased revenue.<\/p> <p>My research with Aaron Yoon of Northwestern University and Mozaffar Khan, a former colleague at HBS, has shown that targeting the right issues brings financial benefits: In analyzing the performance of more than 2,000 U.S. companies over 21 years, we found that those firms that improved on <em>material<\/em> ESG issues significantly outperformed their competitors. (Materiality was identified by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, or SASB, which offers a list of salient issues for 77 industries. I served as an unpaid member of SASB&#8217;s Standards Council from 2012 to 2014.) Interestingly, companies that outperformed on <em>immaterial<\/em> ESG issues slightly underperformed their competitors. This suggests that investors are becoming sophisticated enough to tell the difference between greenwashing and value creation.<\/p> <p>Of course, materiality is not a static concept. The strategic challenge for corporate leaders is to be foresighted about the ESG themes that are emerging as important industry drivers&#8212;to identify them before their competitors do (and in some cases ahead of SASB too). This requires leaders to conceptualize the various actors in the system, their incentives, and the interventions that could drive change. Although that may sound straightforward, it is not. But my research with Jean Rogers, the founder and former CEO of SASB, revealed that an ESG issue is likely to become financially material under certain conditions:<\/p> <ul> <li>when it becomes easier for management and external stakeholders to gain insight into a company&#8217;s environmental or social impact (consider how technological advances now make it possible to trace the raw materials in electronic products and discern those that have been unsustainably mined)<\/li> <li>when the media and NGOs have more power and politicians are more responsive to it (such scenarios have prompted the creation and enforcement of anticorruption laws and other new regulations)<\/li> <li>when companies lack the ability to effectively self-regulate (for instance, this is the case in the palm oil industry, where a misalignment of incentives for farmers leads to deforestation)<\/li> <li>when a company develops a differentiated service or product that replaces a &#8220;dirty&#8221; or unsustainable way of doing business (think of Tesla, with its potential to disrupt the market for gasoline-powered cars)<\/li> <\/ul> <p>IKEA is one company that has mapped out a strategic ESG program, transforming itself in response to accelerating environmental degradation. It has introduced various product, service, and process innovations to move away from its traditional retailing of inexpensive furniture that customers often discard quickly. It recently entered the home solar and energy-storage business, which grew by 29% in 2019. And while most competitors are focusing on using materials more efficiently or trying to find ways to recycle products <em>after<\/em> they have been designed, IKEA has launched an effort to completely rethink product design. The aim is to create products that can be reused, refurbished, remanufactured, or recycled, thereby extending their lifespan. Moreover, IKEA products will be modularized to make them easy to dismantle and reuse as raw materials when they&#8217;re no longer functional. Although this process will take years, the firm will most likely emerge as a circular-economy leader as more regulatory, consumer, and brand pressures force companies to compete on products with better environmental credentials.<\/p> <p>While IKEA&#8217;s strategy involves moving away from wasteful practices, other firms have found that strategic reviews can identify ways to differentiate by leaning in to positive impact. When senior leaders at Vaseline interviewed medical professionals at the Centers for Disease Control, Doctors Without Borders, and the UN Refugee Agency, they learned that Vaseline jelly was an indispensable part of emergency first-aid kits, particularly in developing countries. They also learned that preventable skin conditions, such as deeply cracked hands and burns from cooking on gas stoves or using kerosene lamps, were keeping people from working, going to school, and engaging in other basic activities&#8212;a situation that Vaseline could help alleviate. That insight led to a new social-impact strategy to help heal the skin of 5 million people living in crisis or conflict. The strategy connected business goals with societal needs and differentiated the brand from competitors while increasing revenue.<\/p> <h2>Accountability Mechanisms<\/h2> <p>The implementation of an ESG strategy involves large operational and strategic changes. It must start at the top with the board and be diffused through the entire organization. (See &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/hbr.org\/2020\/09\/making-sustainability-count#the-boards-role-in-sustainability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Board&#8217;s Role in Sustainability<\/a>&#8221; in this package.) Yet my research shows that in most companies the board of directors is far removed from the firm&#8217;s ESG efforts. This is a mistake. The board should be the entity that ensures that ESG metrics are properly considered in executive compensation and are adequately measured and disclosed as part of the audit committee&#8217;s work. Indeed, my colleagues and I have found that one of the characteristics of organizations with high ESG performance is a process that deeply embeds ESG issues in the board&#8217;s work and in executive pay.<\/p> <p>Although most large global companies say that their boards oversee sustainability, that generally happens in a piecemeal fashion. There are exceptions. BNP Paribas is a global financial company taking a systematic approach to sustainability governance. The company has directors who are active participants in sustainable-finance forums, including a chair who was formerly the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Large polluters, such as BHP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Eskom, have linked executive incentives to their carbon emissions, motivating management to act as it faces increased risk of regulation and competition from new technologies. Microsoft and other technology firms have tied executive compensation to workforce diversity targets, an ESG issue that&#8217;s critical for an industry in which competitiveness requires innovation, fresh ideas, and creative thinking.<\/p> <h2>The Power of Purpose<\/h2> <p>A top-down approach to sustainability and good governance is not effective if it is not supported from the bottom up by a culture that rallies around ESG initiatives. Many strategic efforts fail because people further down in the organizational hierarchy don&#8217;t believe there is a true commitment to ESG goals or they lack clear direction for achieving them. Skepticism, even cynicism, leads such efforts to be sidelined or inconsistently implemented across functions, divisions, and business lines.<\/p> <p>To remedy this problem, organizations must identify a corporate purpose and build a culture around it. When Claudine Gartenberg of the Wharton School, Andrea Prat of Columbia University, and I analyzed data from more than 1,000 U.S. companies and 1.5 million employees, we found that clarity about a sense of purpose declines from senior management to middle management and then to lower-level employees. We also found that firms able to flatten the hierarchy and diffuse a sense of purpose through the ranks outperformed their competitors.<\/p> <p>In recent years a lot has been written about purpose, but not much consensus exists about what the term actually means. The most high-profile articulation of the concept came from Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the largest asset management firm in the world. He wrote that &#8220;a company cannot achieve long-term profits without embracing purpose&#8221; because &#8220;a strong sense of purpose and a commitment to stakeholders helps a company connect more deeply to its customers and adjust to the changing demands of society.&#8221; In August 2019, CEOs from 181 of the world&#8217;s largest companies&#8212;as part of the lobbying group Business Roundtable (BRT)&#8212;modified a position that the group had held since 1977 by declaring that the purpose of a corporation is not just to serve shareholders but to create value for all stakeholders.<\/p> <p>Neither Fink&#8217;s nor BRT&#8217;s assertion explains exactly what purpose is, of course. But we definitely know what it is not: words you see on a wall when you enter company headquarters, mission statements posted on websites, or grandiose speeches by CEOs in town halls. Research has shown those to be &#8220;cheap talk&#8221; that is unrelated to real outcomes in the organization.<\/p> <p>My colleagues and I have defined purpose as how employees&#8212;the people who know the organization best&#8212;perceive the meaning and impact of their work. To measure employees&#8217; sense of purpose in three of our recent studies, we used questions from surveys by the Great Place to Work Institute, asking participants to rate their level of agreement with statements such as &#8220;My work has special meaning; it&#8217;s not just a job,&#8221; &#8220;I feel proud of the ways that we contribute to the community,&#8221; and &#8220;Management has a clear view of where the organization is going and how to get there.&#8221;<\/p> <p>Investors seem to be paying increasing attention to companies that are effective at linking strategy to purpose. The Strategic Investor Initiative, an outgrowth of the Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose coalition, recently collaborated with KKS Advisors (which I cofounded) to analyze 20 CEO presentations on long-term strategic plans. We found that when CEOs did well at communicating corporate purpose, stock prices and trade volume rose in the following days. The implication is that investors find value in information about purpose. In one of the presentations we studied, Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck, told shareholders: &#8220;Our purpose is very clear to us and all of our people, and that is to discover and develop lifesaving medicines for society.&#8221; He added, &#8220;That&#8217;s what makes our people come to work every day. It&#8217;s what makes them make the tremendous commitment that gives them the willingness to make the discretionary effort.&#8221;<\/p> <p>For some companies, defining their purpose means leaving money on the table, at least in the short term. This is the case with automakers that are transitioning away from carbon-emitting gas-powered cars and moving toward electric vehicles, which are more eco-friendly but less profitable. The good news, though, is that we&#8217;re seeing more examples proving that a long-term trade-off between profits and sustainability is not necessary, given that companies can redesign how they generate revenue. Consider Philips Lighting, which has shifted from selling light bulb products with limited lifespans to selling lighting as a sustainable service. Customers pay for the light they use rather than investing in the physical assets, while Philips retains ownership of all lighting equipment and takes it back when it&#8217;s suitable for recycling or upgrading.<\/p> <div class=\"article-callout\"><div class=\"callout-contents\"><p><span class=\"callout\">Investors find value in information about purpose.<\/span><\/p> <\/div><\/div> <p>Commitment to a purpose will also push companies to sometimes undertake initiatives that might not pencil out in P&#38;L terms. Frazier described such an initiative when he spoke about Merck&#8217;s effort to develop an Ebola vaccine: &#8220;It would have been impossible to say&#8230;&#8216;We won&#8217;t go there, because we don&#8217;t see a robust commercial market.&#8217; And I think that&#8217;s part of what [we are] talking about in terms of having a purpose-driven organization.&#8221;<\/p> <p>As more companies work to articulate their purpose and build a culture that fully embraces it, we will learn more about what ensures success. However, my research with Gartenberg already points to three key conditions: an intentional strategy to grow leaders within the organization, resulting in the promotion of internal candidates to the CEO role; fair compensation structures (in which the ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay is not extreme for the industry); and careful execution of mergers and acquisitions to avoid culture clashes. Though the reasons aren&#8217;t fully understood, the research suggests that externally hired CEOs and companies with more acquisitions need to work harder to create a sense of purpose.<\/p> <h2>Operational Changes<\/h2> <p>In studying firms that have successfully implemented an ESG strategy, I&#8217;ve noticed that they tend to pass through three phases: efforts to reduce risk and ensure compliance with environmental regulations and other laws; efforts to improve operating efficiency; and efforts to innovate and grow. To achieve this evolution, exemplary firms usually start by centralizing ESG activities, which is helpful for moving from a focus on risk and compliance to a focus on operating efficiency. But to reach the innovation and growth stage, companies need to decentralize ESG activities and empower corporate functions to take responsibility for them. This is true in terms of distributing power from the C-suite to middle management, but it&#8217;s also true at the board level. Initially a board needs to set up a separate sustainability committee. But at the third stage it will typically reallocate responsibilities to preexisting board committees (audit, nomination, and so forth).<\/p> <p>Of course, decentralization requires appropriate support mechanisms. For example, the chemicals company Solvay developed a tool to assess the environmental impact of each of its product applications. This has enabled decision-makers in separate functions to take environmental considerations into account when discharging their respective responsibilities&#8212;for apportioning the R&#38;D budget, underwriting risks during the due diligence phase of acquisitions, or optimizing plant manufacturing operations as regulations change. From 2016 to 2018 Solvay saw 4% annual growth in sales of products that have low environmental impact, while sales of more-damaging products declined by 5%.<\/p> <p>As the ESG field continues to mature, investors will be looking at how organizations are structured to deliver on their stated purpose. To increase the odds of success, winning companies will make sure that the people who manage the most important determinants of ESG performance have the capabilities and resources needed to get the job done.<\/p> <p>A first step is to ensure that the chief sustainability officer, or the senior executive charged with ESG responsibilities, is the person closest to the company&#8217;s most material ESG issues. If brands are critical assets (as they are for consumer goods companies), this individual might be the chief marketing or chief brand officer. If risk management is a central concern for the enterprise (as is the case for financial institutions), this person could be the chief risk or chief investment officer. If human capital issues matter most, the responsibility for ESG activities might fall to the head of human resources. At Tyson Foods, the former chief sustainability officer also served as the executive vice president of corporate strategy and led continuous-improvement efforts. Additionally, he managed Tyson&#8217;s venture fund, which is investing in plant-based protein and cultured meat as more-sustainable alternatives to traditional meat products.<\/p> <div><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-269685 mbn pbn\" src=\"http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-1024x576.jpg\" srcset=\"http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-1024x576.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-300x169.jpg 300w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-768x432.jpg 768w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-500x281.jpg 500w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-383x215.jpg 383w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-700x394.jpg 700w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B-850x478.jpg 850w, http:\/\/wp.qa.hbr.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/R2005B_PLANK_B.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"\" data-sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" \/><span class=\"credit line-height-tight\">Marlies Plank<\/span><\/div> <div class=\"font-size-default line-height-tight text-gray-light mts pts\">About the art: Marlies Plank is fascinated by the surreal effect of large soap bubbles floating through landscapes.

Although top leaders should set ESG targets, unit heads and middle management should be empowered to figure out how to hit them. Paradoxically, audacious targets are more likely to be met than modest ones are. That was the finding that emerged when Ioannou and I, along with Shelley Xin Li of the University of Southern California, analyzed more than 800 corporate targets related to climate change. And a separate study&#8212;one I did with Grewal and my Harvard Business School colleague David Freiberg&#8212;confirmed the benefits of aiming high: We looked at more than 1,000 firms and discovered that those with relatively ambitious targets relating to climate change invested more than their peers, made significant operating changes, and, in the process, drove innovation.<\/p> <h2>Communicate with the (Right) Investors<\/h2> <p>Companies must avoid slavishly focusing on improving their ESG ratings, but communication with the investor community is nevertheless important. Often, however, decisions about what to measure and how to keep investors informed are clouded by misconceptions.<\/p> <p>The first is the belief among many corporate leaders that a firm&#8217;s investor base is not subject to influence or control by management. In reality, a company <em>can<\/em> influence who buys its stock and, if necessary, change the base of shareholders. It&#8217;s not as easy as shaping one&#8217;s customer or employee base, but it&#8217;s possible. For example, before Shire was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, it significantly altered its investor base from 2006 to 2012 by committing to integrating financially material ESG issues into its strategy and reporting on them to its shareholders. Dedicated long-term investors (including Aviva Investors, Scottish Widows, and the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund) initially owned a small fraction of Shire&#8217;s stock, but their holdings increased steadily and eventually became greater than those of transient investors&#8212;a highly uncommon phenomenon for a publicly listed company.<\/p> <p>The second misconception is that the demands of sell-side analysts employed by big brokerage houses should determine what must be communicated. Most companies still emphasize mostly short-term information in their investor communications. That&#8217;s because they view the sell side as the traditional &#8220;customer&#8221; of investor relations. That needs to change; the focus should be on communicating directly with the buy side&#8212;the large institutional asset managers that hold the company&#8217;s stock.<\/p> <div class=\"article-callout\"><div class=\"callout-contents\"><p><span class=\"callout\">Some companies are already experimenting with impact-weighted accounting.<\/span><\/p> <\/div><\/div> <p>The third misconception is that ESG metrics are sufficient for investors to integrate ESG considerations into their business analysis, valuation, and modeling. In fact, investors struggle to embed those metrics in financial models because it&#8217;s not clear what they mean or how they can affect the financials. One solution might be the creation of a system of impact-weighted accounting that could measure a firm&#8217;s environmental and social impacts (both positive and negative), convert them to monetary terms, and then reflect them in financial statements. Though the science to do this has yet to be perfected, such a system holds great promise for three reasons: It would translate impacts into units of measurement that business managers and investors understand; it would allow for the use of financial and business analysis tools to consider those impacts; and it would enable an aggregation and comparison of analyses across types of impact that would not be possible without standardized units of measurement.<\/p> <p>At the Impact-Weighted Accounts Initiative (a Harvard Business School project that I lead), we are collaborating with the Global Steering Group for Impact Investing and the Impact Management Project on a simple approach: adjusting traditional accounting measures to consider the various types of impact that ESG actions might have. These include <em>product<\/em> impact, which affects revenue numbers; <em>employment<\/em> impact, which affects employee expenditures on the income statement; and <em>environmental<\/em> impact, which affects the cost of goods sold. For example, positive product impact could mean more revenue for a company and potentially higher growth. Positive employment impact (measured by, say, resources spent on employee training) would send investors a strong signal that management views employee expenditures as investments that lead to future profitability and not merely as expenses. Negative environmental impact might raise the cost of goods sold, by triggering new and restrictive regulations.<\/p> <p>Valuing a company&#8217;s effects on people and the planet&#8212;and integrating that into traditional financial analysis&#8212;will offer a more comprehensive picture of actual corporate performance. Some companies, such as the science-oriented DSM and the pharmaceutical giant Novartis, are already experimenting with impact-weighted accounting. Novartis estimated its employment impact for 2017&#8212;including benefits derived from employee development, occupational safety efforts, and payment of a living wage&#8212;at $7 billion. Its environmental impact, as measured by carbon emissions and water and waste impacts, was calculated at $4.7 billion. Positive product impact, something that has been largely missing from most ESG investment frameworks, was estimated at $72 billion.<\/p> <p>A final, fundamental misconception about investor relations is the idea that ESG disclosure is transaction-based and can happen intermittently. Companies need to instead see it as an opportunity for continual reputation and relationship building. It used to be that most communication with investors (the buy side) was happening through Wall Street analysts (the sell side). Increasingly, investors want a direct line of communication, and they appreciate proactive information sharing, which has the added benefit of extending investor patience. Performance declines may occur. But if CEOs come to investors with an excuse after the fact, without having built trust, they are unlikely to be given the leeway or the time they need to reverse the decline.<\/p> <h2>The Path Forward<\/h2> <p>Many companies have failed to recognize that the functional role of ESG data has changed over time. Initially such data was used to judge a company&#8217;s willingness to avoid harm and do good. As a result, it was primarily an input to help form policies that signaled a firm&#8217;s commitment to achieving positive outcomes for the environment and society.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>Imagine a consultant telling a C-level executive in 2019 that huge swaths of their company could transition to remote work with only a few days&#8217; notice, they would experience a productivity boost after an adjustment period, and many of those workers would not want to return to the office. The consultant&#8217;s contract likely wouldn&#8217;t be renewed. Even so, surveys <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hbs.edu\/ris\/Publication%20Files\/20-138_ec6ff0f0-7947-4607-9d54-c5c53044fb95.pdf\">conducted independently<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/adamozimek.com\/admin\/pdf\/covidremote.pdf\">by both authors<\/a> indicate this is an accurate description of the remote work evolution for many firms. The forced experiment with remote work over the past two years has shown some organizations the upside of approaches to work they would never have otherwise considered. It also showed workers that they aren&#8217;t as locked into the traditional, in-office 9-5 at one company as they might have thought. For both, there&#8217;s no going back.<\/p> <p>Hybrid and remote work aren&#8217;t the end of the story, however. The new capabilities organizations have for remote work have opened up new possibilities, and now is the time for leaders to assess how other changes to the employment model could work for them.<\/p> <p>A flexible or open talent model is particularly worth considering. Flexible and open talent are broad terms, covering scenarios from local freelancers coming on-premises to globally distributed online contractors to innovation sourcing through tournaments or contests. The defining feature is project-based or temporary work that is staffed with workers who are not permanently attached to a company. If done correctly, these ways of working can help organizations access skilled talent while providing the flexibility that many workers increasingly crave.<\/p> <article-promo class=\"article-promo promo--right\"><hbr-component type=\"promo\" is-insight=\"insight-center\" title=\"Reimagining Work\" dek=\"Beyond a return to &#8220;normal.&#8221;\" cta-text=\"\" href=\"\/insight-center\/reimagining-work\"><\/hbr-component><\/article-promo> <p>Just like with remote work prior to Covid, companies have been slow to adopt these models. As the chief economist of a large work marketplace, Upwork, and an academic who has studied open talent for more than a decade, we tracked a slow uptick in enterprise use of open talent in the years prior to the pandemic. But now, as remote work has become normalized, we&#8217;re seeing a rapid change.<\/p> <p>To help companies understand and take advantage of new possibilities that open talent allows, we want to highlight some trends in the flexible\/open talent landscape, comment on what jobs or tasks are most amenable to this model, and outline considerations for managers to get started.<\/p> <h2>Why Use Flexible and Open Talent?<\/h2> <p>Flexible models have traditionally served three purposes.<\/p> <ul> <li>First, flexibility allows organizations to scale staffing up and down, accommodating labor demand variability.<\/li> <li>Second, flexible models allow small-task outsourcing for situations where hiring a full-time equivalent would not be justified and where the overhead requirements of traditional temporary staffing solutions would slow the project or be cost-prohibitive.<\/li> <li>Third, flexible talent strategies provide access to innovative or diverse skillsets beyond traditional recruiting pipelines. Industry leaders like Netflix and NASA have found that contests with external participants often beat internal innovation benchmarks for similar projects.<\/li> <\/ul> <p>Still, there have been barriers to organizations adopting the open model. At Upwork, a leading online labor market, the sales team saw some common stumbling blocks from potential clients. Discomfort with remote work was one of the most significant, as flexible talent is disproportionately remote. Resistance also comes from enterprise inertia or bureaucracy, concerns about IP or security risks, and a lack of familiarity with the tools and management practices that make open talent effective. As a result, companies sought talent primarily in their local labor markets or de-facto recruiting networks, and primarily for traditional hiring arrangements.<\/p> <p>Things are beginning to change, however. In surveys conducted by Ozimek from a representative panel of firms, more than half of hiring managers indicated that remote work has opened up their ability or willingness to utilize remote freelancers, both during the pandemic and going forward.<\/p> <p>The supply of workers interested in these models has simultaneously swelled. Self-employment rates <a href=\"https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=MBS8\">have surged<\/a> over the past year, supporting anecdotal reports that many considering adding to the Great Resignation were seeking more flexibility and control over their lives. In a representative survey of working-age people in the U.S., one out of five respondents who could work mostly remotely during the pandemic reported considering freelancing to stay remote. Among those who would consider freelancing, a more flexible schedule was what they value most.<\/p> <p>In a series of Upwork surveys, respondents reported both opportunities for and interest in using more freelance options. Respondents who had worked with or hired independent staff in the last year said that, without the external help, they would have done the work themselves (35%) or asked their teams to do it (28%) &#8212; options that could contribute to burnout. Twenty percent said they would have hired an outside service company; 3% would have hired a staffing firm. Just 8% said they would have made new full-time hires, and 6% said the work simply wouldn&#8217;t have been done.<\/p> <p>Respondents also reported having contracted significantly more freelancers during the pandemic (53% said they made more use of remote freelancers compared to their pre-pandemic baseline, vs. just 6% who hired fewer freelancers) and planned to make more use of it over the next two years (47% vs. 11%).<strong><br \/> <\/strong><\/p> <h2>What Jobs or Tasks Are Most Amenable to the Flexible\/Open Talent Model?<\/h2> <p>The flexible\/open model has proven effective for a wide range of jobs and tasks. The top skill categories on Upwork are administrative support (including relatively rote tasks like data entry) and web\/software development. These skills run the gamut from easy-to-find to rare, highly specialized, and highly compensated. Other platforms, such as Topcoder, concentrate on contests &#8212; a model that has proven incredibly valuable for innovation &#8212; with typical tournaments containing high-level programming or machine learning work or more subjective design work.<\/p> <p>Given the range of skills available on open platforms, there are a few situations where it makes particular sense to use open talent. Specifically, when:<\/p> <ol> <li>Insiders cannot be redeployed easily.<\/li> <li>Outsiders are less expensive than hiring a new insider or paying overtime to existing ones.<\/li> <li>Highly specialized skills are needed and they are not available internally.<\/li> <li>Returns on exceptional solutions are high.<\/li> <\/ol> <p>In the first three situations, companies are responding to a simple need for talent, but the last underscores another important motivation: In many contexts outsiders have been found to beat insiders head-to-head. Outsiders can provide many different approaches or solutions to a given problem, allowing the organization to choose the best one.<\/p> <p>But, perhaps even more important than the situation that brought firms to open talent, there&#8217;s the nature of the task itself. There are a few important variables that companies should weigh before deciding how to utilize open\/flexible talent.<\/p> <p>For one, the level of firm-specific knowledge required for a project will typically tip the balance between insiders and outsiders. While freelancers can build complex database-driven web applications from scratch &#8212; perhaps more efficiently than the internal employees of many firms &#8212; a project that requires interfacing effectively with existing applications that require significant firm-specific context will mean either: a) an internal employee is needed to form the bridge; b) the freelancer must learn the internal systems (potentially at higher cost than an internal employee); or c) an internal employee will serve an integration role that builds on the freelancer&#8217;s work.<\/p> <p>Then there&#8217;s the question of whether a project or task is recurring. All hiring and onboarding has some costs &#8212; whether screening a freelancer, setting up a contest, or hiring a full-time role. If a project or task is going to be repeated over time, the scale tips toward making a more permanent hire to economize on these costs, especially if they involve training a new hire on firm-specific processes. On the other hand, a repeated task can be suitable for open talent if it involves common skills and requires little firm-specific context.<\/p> <p>Finally, there are integration costs of incorporating work from an open talent solution into the larger organization. These tend to be low for projects that require little firm specific knowledge and can be very high for a project for highly firm-specific tasks.<\/p> <p><!-- start -- When Open Talent Works -- table --><\/p> <div class=\"table-container has-border-top has-border-bottom mtl ptl mbl pbl\"> <h4>When Open Talent Works<\/h4> <p> <span class=\"dek\">How firms can decide when an open model makes sense.<\/span> <\/p> <table class=\"grid-table-container has-no-border\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"5\"> <thead> <tr> <th width=\"25%\">Firm-Specific Knowledge Required, by Task Frequency<\/th> <th width=\"25%\">Low<\/th> <th width=\"25%\">Medium<\/th> <th width=\"25%\">Large<\/th> <\/tr> <\/thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Firm-Specific Knowledge Required, by Task Frequency<\/p> <p class=\"font-bold\">One-off<\/p> <\/td> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Low<\/p> <p class=\"\">Use open\/flexible<\/p> <\/td> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Medium<\/p> <p class=\"\">Open\/flexible can be used if integration costs are low enough<\/p> <\/td> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Large<\/p> <p class=\"\">Use traditional employees unless tasks can be broken down to remove need for firm-specific context<\/p> <\/td> <\/tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Firm-Specific Knowledge Required, by Task Frequency<\/p> <p class=\"font-bold\">Recurring<\/p> <\/td> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Low<\/p> <p class=\"\">Open\/flexible can be used if recruiting\/screening costs are low enough<\/p> <\/td> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Medium<\/p> <p class=\"\">Open\/flexible can be used if integration costs and recruiting\/screening costs are low enough<\/p> <\/td> <td> <p class=\"font-bold\">Large<\/p> <p class=\"\">Use traditional employees<\/p> <\/td> <\/tr> <\/tbody> <\/table> <div class=\"table-footer\"> <p class=\"\"> <!-- Source: goes here --><\/p> <p class=\"\"> <\/p><\/div> <\/div> <p><!-- end -- When Open Talent Works -- table --><\/p> <p>With these factors in mind, we believe that remote work is hastening a shift that reduces hiring, screening, and monitoring costs for managers and lessens burdens on workers to understand firm-specific context.<\/p> <p>A few important changes have brought us here. First, we&#8217;ve seen a mindset shift around remote work. Hiring managers for remote positions are now more comfortable interfacing with people they have not met personally, opening the door to work from anywhere &#8212; and to open\/flexible hiring. Second, companies have invested in virtual communications tools (e.g., video calls and screen sharing) that make it easier to troubleshoot problems remotely and give outside workers a way to interface and get\/give feedback. Third, remote work and tools like Slack have forced companies to better define tasks, codifying processes and specifications, making it easier to write specifications that a worker with little firm-specific knowledge can understand, which can enable opening up a company.<\/p> <p>So, where should companies start?<\/p> <h2>What Managers Should Do<\/h2> <p>Platforms are the primary way freelancers and companies find each other for open\/flexible work, and help establish trust for both workers and employers. For the freelance workers, they offer protection through payment guarantees and dispute resolution mechanisms, and the ability to establish a verified track record of feedback and reputation scores &#8212; a kind of virtual resume. For employers, this track record offers confidence when hiring from a global talent pool. They don&#8217;t need to understand the specifics of a local labor market &#8212; how a college ranks, which employers signal particular ability, etc. &#8212; to find the right person for a job.<\/p> <p>If hiring managers decide to use platforms, there are a few things to think about as you navigate them.<\/p> <p>Platforms make hiding failure much harder, which is likely to be especially useful for those who don&#8217;t have the skills to evaluate a new hire (e.g., poets who want to hire quants and quants who want to hire poets). Market signals from past buyers help with that screening process, and the platforms provide objective measures of past performance &#8212; something that&#8217;s nearly impossible to come by in traditional HR. And because every transaction contributes not just to current earnings but to future earnings through public signals of on-the-job performance, the threat of poor feedback serves as a disciplining device that likely improves contract fulfillment rates.<\/p> <p>Platforms primarily make money from successful matches, as up-front fees are minimal. As a result, clients can hire a freelancer for a short-term project without making a huge investment before deciding to hire them on a permanent basis. As remote work expands the pool of both potential employers and employees, the opportunity for better matches increases, making &#8220;try before you buy&#8221; with flexible talent more valuable than ever.<\/p> <p>If you begin your journey outside of platforms, use the insights for why platforms exist so that you can design your own processes to circumvent the information problems platforms attempt to solve.<\/p> <p>This likely means you need some way to screen applicants, like with employment histories, or to use a format like contests that make employment histories irrelevant. Incentive alignment in this case cannot come from the promise of a public signal of good feedback, but instead may come from a pathway to a permanent position or a substantial bonus upon project success.<\/p> <p>Hiring managers should be aware of firm-specific context and try to minimize it, while making sure any solution you procure from outsiders can be integrated. For example, Netflix was able to get more than 2,000 submissions <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Netflix_Prize\">in their famous prediction challenge<\/a> by providing an easy-to-understand database of movie ratings that didn&#8217;t force participants to understand the underlying architecture of Netflix&#8217;s backend systems.<\/p> <p>You also can run some experiments and horserace different models. Try to measure the results of comparable tasks or projects done in different ways (internally and through open talent). This will allow you to measure productivity under different conditions. We believe the idiosyncratic nature of most production means an experiment is more valuable than broad advice. Experiments may also include trying different formats &#8212; contests or hourly contracts &#8212; and different platforms with different mixes of contractors.<\/p> <p>For those firms running experiments, we would be grateful if you let us know how things go. Feel free to send us an email (<a href=\"mailto:cstanton@hbs.edu\">cstanton@hbs.edu<\/a>) with your progress.<\/p> <p>Finally, many organizations may worry about information leakage, especially around trade secrets or intellectual property. However, even before the pandemic, freelancing and contest platforms evolved to address many of these problems, and their lessons are useful for managers thinking about hiring any remote worker, not just a freelancer. Many platforms contain support for non-disclosure agreements and other legal agreements that can help to protect IP. It&#8217;s also possible that the decontextualization that helps to facilitate using open talent reduces IP risk &#8212; for example, information leakage without context tends to be a less useful datapoint than seeing the big picture. In fact, many quantitative hedge funds manage IP risks in similar ways. As a result, the open model can potentially create siloes that, in some cases, protect IP better than traditional working arrangements.<\/p> <h2>What Will This Mean in the Long Run?<\/h2> <p>What will a broader move to flexible talent mean for pay? Managers who are used to leveraging an army of consultants or temps from staffing agencies might expect to pay a premium for flexible talent, whereas those who have outsourced work to low-cost areas may expect cost savings. Managers should recognize that increases in the willingness to use open talent will mean competition with the best firms for the best talent. In a globalized, online economy, Western firms won&#8217;t just compete with local Indian firms for the best Indian talent, but instead with anyone willing to pay for digital work. As a result, we expect that open talent will help democratize access to opportunities, and will potentially raise living standards in places where local opportunities are scarce.<\/p> <p>To conclude, gaining practice with remote work seems to open up possibilities for leveraging flexible or open talent. When done well, these models can drive exceptional results, but they require purposeful management.<\/p>",

        "content": "<p>For digital retailers, the ability to revise prices swiftly and on a large scale has emerged as a decisive differentiator&#8212;especially during periods of inflation, when prices fluctuate more frequently. Many retailers scrape rivals&#8217; websites for price information and use it to set their own prices manually or automatically, often using a strategy of charging X dollars or X percent less than the lowest-price competitor. However, retailers that use such simple heuristics miss significant opportunities because they fail to tailor their responses to product availability and demand, among other factors.</p>\n<p>Recognizing this, more retailers are now applying machine-learning models to guide their pricing decisions. The algorithms associate price changes with sales changes by mining waves of historical data on purchases, prices, and product characteristics. Despite this sophistication, research shows that such efforts achieve, on average, an improvement in revenues or profits of 1% or less. By relying on historical data to set prices, for example, a retailer might unnecessarily match a competitor&#8217;s low price for an item that the rival does not have in stock. Or it might match a low price even though factors other than price are the main drivers of customers&#8217; purchase choices, such as the product&#8217;s quality or brand reputation.</p>\n<p>Some retailers have figured out a way to overcome these challenges and, as a result, have realized double-digit growth in revenues and profits. They have shifted away from relying on manual decision-making based on historical sales to using automated systems driven by sophisticated algorithms that consider a range of factors, allowing them to optimize prices in real time.</p>\n<p>In this article, we describe a step-by-step process for building an AI-powered pricing model that starts by understanding how consumers decide what and where to buy, conducting experiments to measure price elasticity (how sensitive the demand for a product is to price), and then applying optimization tools to set prices that maximize revenue or profit. Thanks to the rapid growth of electronic shelf labels, our process can also be applied in brick-and-mortar retail settings. It can be especially useful in pricing perishable goods such as food and fashion, where retailers must dynamically adjust the prices of products nearing their expiration dates to incentivize faster sales and reduce waste.</p>\n<div class=\"article-callout\"><div class=\"callout-contents\"><p><span class=\"callout\">Some retailers apply machine-learning models that use historical data to guide pricing decisions. But such efforts improve revenues and profits by only 1% or less.</span></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>To illustrate our process, we rely primarily on our experiences with two companies with whom we worked as academic partners. The first was a multibillion-dollar Chinese online retailer that experienced meteoric growth driven by an increasingly broad product assortment, geographic expansion, and aggressive pricing. It positioned itself in the market as a low-price merchant and beat or matched its competitors&#8217; prices. It scraped competitors&#8217; websites daily but set prices manually for the most part. The second was a leading U.S. online retailer with annual revenues of several billion dollars. It had a dedicated pricing analytics team, and nearly half of its products were priced algorithmically. Like the first retailer, it scraped competitors&#8217; websites, daily for fast-moving SKUs and weekly or semiweekly for slower-moving SKUs.</p>\n<p>Here is our seven-step process, which you can use to unlock the full potential of your own dynamic pricing system.</p>\n<h2>1. Choose Your Focus</h2>\n<p>Start by thinking about what products you want to focus on: top sellers, midrange sellers, or long-tail products. Make your choice based on how concentrated your sales are. If you generate the majority of your sales (say, more than 80% of total revenue) from a handful of products, begin your implementation with those top sellers. If your sales are not concentrated&#8212;as is the case for home decor and grocery retailers, for example&#8212;focus on midrange sellers or long-tail products. In such scenarios, you need to have (or be ready to build) the analytics capability required to do dynamic pricing for a vast number of products.</p>\n<p>Our work with the Chinese online retailer&#8212;a market leader in baby and mom products such as feeding bottles, diapers, and breast pumps&#8212;began when its chairman asked us whether always matching the lowest-price competitor was a good strategy. He and his executives questioned the need to price match for every single product they sold and to follow competitors&#8217; moves even when it was evident that a rival had made a pricing mistake (by setting prices either unrealistically high or low). Before engaging with us, the retailer&#8217;s pricing decisions were largely made manually by product managers, each of whom oversaw a few dozen product lines. The managers closely followed the trends of relevant brands and products, such as their popularity among consumers, the introductions of new products (or new versions of existing products), as well as competitors&#8217; prices. The product managers would then determine on a daily or weekly basis what prices they would charge for each product. Given that this manual process was extremely time-consuming, they typically paid more attention to high-volume SKUs and only occasionally adjusted the prices of others.</p>\n<div class=\"article-callout\"><div class=\"callout-contents\"><p><span class=\"callout\">In categories whose sales are dominated by a few products, you can use a sophisticated model; in categories whose sales are highly distributed, use a scalable model.</span></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>We began our work with feeding bottles. This subcategory was dominated by a handful of products offered by a few domestic and international brands. We focused on the top 30 SKUs, which represented more than 80% of the total revenue for the subcategory. The implementation of our AI-powered pricing model ultimately led to an 11% increase in revenue for these top sellers while maintaining the gross margin for the category. We then focused on several other categories, such as small appliances and kitchen hardware, where a handful of fast-moving products accounted for the majority of the revenue. These additional implementations achieved revenue increases of up to 19% without compromising profit margins.</p>\n<p>The U.S. online retailer&#8217;s sales&#8212;primarily home furnishings such as beds, coffee tables, rugs, and decor&#8212;were not concentrated among a few top sellers. In each subcategory, the company carried from a few hundred to thousands of SKUs, and its sales were fairly evenly distributed among the products it sells.</p>\n<p>Before engaging with us, it used an algorithm to price about half of its SKUs automatically. However, it had only recently started scraping competitors&#8217; websites for their prices and was wondering how best to respond to their price changes. We quickly implemented a dynamic price-response system for more than 10,000 products. During a month-long testing period it led to a 15% increase in revenue and a 10% increase in profit for four categories in the pilot: beds, ottomans, coffee tables, and barstools.</p>\n<p>The key trade-off in the focus choice between top sellers or a broad product range is algorithm sophistication versus scalability. A sophisticated system usually involves complex modeling techniques, such as nonlinear models, which are great at understanding the complicated ways consumers make decisions and giving accurate answers to pricing questions. But these models are difficult to work with when you have lots of SKUs. For example, a linear model dealing with thousands of variables or SKUs can optimize the decisions it produces within a few seconds; a complex model can take days or weeks even with the most advanced computing capabilities.</p>\n<p>Retailers can manage this trade-off at the category level: In categories whose sales are dominated by a few products, you can use a sophisticated model; in categories whose sales are highly distributed, use a scalable model. Within a category, you can implement both types of algorithms by adopting the standard ABC classification system. (Group A is the 20% of SKUs that account for 80% of revenues, group B is the 30% of SKUs that generate 15% of revenues, and group C is the 50% of SKUs that generate 5% of revenues.) Apply a more sophisticated approach for group A items, which are the main contributors to revenue or profit, and a scalable approach for groups B and C.</p>\n<h2>2. Build a Consumer Decision Model</h2>\n<p>Before you can make good pricing decisions, you need to understand how your consumers make purchasing decisions. People are always making choices: which products to buy (Philips Avent versus Dr. Brown&#8217;s feeding bottles, anti-colic feeding bottles versus regular ones) and where or from whom to buy them (from you or one of your competitors). Obviously, price is a consideration in their decisions, but it&#8217;s not the only one. Other factors include product quality, product availability, the reputation of the brand, customer reviews, supplier reliability, purchasing convenience, and the return and exchange policy of the retailer. Moreover, each consumer approaches purchasing decisions differently. Some may be willing to pay more for a reputable brand; others may be bargain hunters. This means that unless most of your customers are looking for the lowest price across retailers, it may not be a good idea to always match competitors&#8217; prices.</p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-363542\" src=\"/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" srcset=\"/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A.jpg 1220w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-292x300.jpg 292w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-996x1024.jpg 996w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-768x789.jpg 768w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-383x394.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-500x514.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-700x720.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-850x874.jpg 850w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_A-1200x1233.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"\" title=\"R2306F_BUTENKOW_A.jpg\" width=\"1220\" height=\"1254\" class=\"size-full wp-image-363542\" /><figcaption class=\"container--caption-credits-inline\"><span class=\"credits--inline-image\">Butenkow/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>In the case of the Chinese retailer, we fed into an algorithm a few months of price and sales information for the SKUs we&#8217;d identified in Step 1, its competitors&#8217; prices for the items, and data on whether individual SKUs for all companies were in stock or not. The algorithm was then able to determine what proportion of consumers preferred to buy from each of the retailers regardless of price and product availability. (In our implementation we didn&#8217;t try to find out what was driving those preferences, but retailers can use a similar approach for factors other than price and product availability.)</p>\n<p>Once you have a good sense of how your customers are making their purchase choices, you can create a consumer decision model, which is a formula that predicts product demand given your and your competitors&#8217; prices along with other key factors, including product availability and the circumstances under which customers are making their purchase decision. For example, you&#8217;ll get better results from a model that tells you how many units of a bed frame you can sell at $195 on a Friday evening when your competitor priced it at $200 than from a model that considers only the competitor&#8217;s price. Whether simple or complex, all models should do one thing: tell you how to price your products in order to achieve the outcomes you care about.</p>\n<p>Using the consumer decision model we developed for the Chinese retailer, we ran an implementation that predicted the sales of every top-selling product given the retailer&#8217;s and its competitors&#8217; prices. The model took into account product characteristics like brand and the intended age range for each type of bottle and product availability at each competitor on a given day. It also considered the prices of products other than baby bottles on the website, because customers often browsed a range of products before making a purchase. In addition, the model factored in days of the week: Customers who visited on Monday were less affected by prices than those who visited on Sunday.</p>\n<div class=\"article-callout\"><div class=\"callout-contents\"><p><span class=\"callout\">Knowing the price elasticity of each product is crucial. If an increase results in very little change in demand, you don&#8217;t need to bother tracking competitors&#8217; prices and matching them.</span></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>For the U.S. online retailer, we used a simplified model to make it more scalable. The model predicted the sales of a particular product looking only at its price and availability and the prices and availability of the same product on competitors&#8217; websites. This simplification allowed the algorithm to quickly scale up to thousands of products. As these two examples show, model parameters can and will vary by product characteristics and retailer. For instance, the demand for a product with higher customer reviews may have a lower price elasticity, and consumers may be more sensitive to Amazon&#8217;s prices than to Home Depot&#8217;s.</p>\n<h2>3. Experiment</h2>\n<p>Now that you have a formula describing how your consumers make purchase decisions, you need to determine the values of the parameters by fitting the formula to your data. The most important variable is price elasticity: the percentage change in demand that results if you raise the price of a product by 1%. Knowing the price elasticity of each of your products is crucial in setting prices intelligently. If a product has a low elasticity (a price increase results in very little change in demand), you do not need to bother tracking competitors&#8217; prices and matching them. But if your consumers can be lured away by competitors that price a penny lower, then you probably have to beat or at least match that price.</p>\n<p>To measure elasticity, you need to systematically vary prices over time and see how consumers react. Many people leave out this step in their implementation of algorithmic pricing, which prevents them from realizing substantial revenue and profit gains. You may ask: Why do I need to experiment when I already have historical data on sales, prices, and product characteristics? Isn&#8217;t it enough to learn price elasticity from this data? And shouldn&#8217;t a good machine-learning program be able to fit a regression line between sales and price given product characteristics? The answer to these questions is &#8220;no,&#8221; for two reasons.</p>\n<p>Prices from the historical data do not vary enough to calculate price elasticity&#8212;either the price itself hasn&#8217;t varied, or it has followed competitors&#8217; prices so closely that the relative price hasn&#8217;t varied. Another problem with historical data is so-called confounders, factors that influence both price and demand but cannot be captured retrospectively. Suppose a retailer conducts a local marketing campaign for a brand and raises the prices of those products in anticipation of increased demand. Historical data could lead to the false conclusion that the higher prices had caused the increase in demand. Experimentation is the best way to avoid these issues.</p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-363543\" src=\"/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 48em) 55.7291667vw, 97.3924381vw\" srcset=\"/resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B.jpg 1220w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-273x300.jpg 273w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-930x1024.jpg 930w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-768x845.jpg 768w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-383x422.jpg 383w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-500x550.jpg 500w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-700x771.jpg 700w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-850x936.jpg 850w, /resources/images/article_assets/2023/09/R2306F_BUTENKOW_B-1200x1321.jpg 1200w\" alt=\"\" title=\"R2306F_BUTENKOW_B.jpg\" width=\"1220\" height=\"1343\" class=\"size-full wp-image-363543\" /><figcaption class=\"container--caption-credits-inline\"><span class=\"credits--inline-image\">Butenkow/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>A common reason retailers hesitate to run price experiments is that they think they are risky: They feel like they are losing control of a crucial decision. But experiments are not risky if you do them right. In our work with both the Chinese and U.S. retailers, we conducted experiments carefully to minimize their potential business impact. In the implementation focusing on the Chinese retailer&#8217;s top sellers, we set a price schedule for the products before the experiment started, which specified a randomly selected price level close to the historical average for each product. Upward and downward price adjustments were balanced such that there was no systematic, directional deviation from historical prices. Prices were varied every three days instead of daily to maintain consumers&#8217; perception of and confidence in the retailer&#8217;s prices.</p>\n<p>In our experiment for the U.S. retailer, which involved more than 10,000 products, we took a different approach. We did not make a preset pricing schedule, because the company already had a pricing algorithm in place. Instead, we took the prices generated daily by the existing algorithm and added variations to them. The prices we chose in the experiment were not a wild draw; they were anchored in the price recommendations generated by the existing pricing system. The experiment thus inherited the intelligence of the company&#8217;s existing practices, which minimized risk while still allowing enough price variation to capture consumers&#8217; decisions under alternative price points.</p>\n<p>In both implementations, we limited the level of price variations to around 3% of the existing or historical prices, and none varied more than 5%, thus minimizing potential risks resulting from large deviations. The double-digit revenue and profit gains we achieved would not have been possible without these careful experiments to measure price elasticity. Retailers often worry that it is too costly to experiment, but our results show that it is even more costly not to.</p>\n<h2>4. Measure</h2>\n<p>Now it is time to marry the data with the model and price-elasticity information. Your objective is to find the best parameters that minimize error when you test your model against your historical sales. Keep in mind that it is always more difficult to predict outcomes at a granular level than at an aggregate level. For example, daily sales are more difficult to predict than weekly sales, which means a 20% prediction error may be good for the daily sales of a given product but bad for its weekly sales.</p>\n<p>In the initiative with the Chinese retailer, we found a wide range of price elasticities: Some were close to zero (price changes had no impact on demand), but most products had elasticities that ranged from -8 to -2. (An elasticity of -8 means that a 1% increase in price will result in an 8% decrease in demand.) The elasticities were correlated with the popularity of the product. The SKU with an elasticity of -8 was bought, on average, 22.5 times per day, and the SKU with nearly inelastic demand was bought only 1.8 times a day. We had similar findings at the U.S. retailer, whose niche, slow-moving furniture items had lower price elasticities than those of fast-moving ones. This makes sense. People are more aware of what is a good price for frequent purchases than they are for products they buy rarely. In supermarkets, for example, consumers are more exposed and sensitive to prices of popular products that are displayed at prominent locations and advertised often, like apples and bread, but fewer people may know the fair price of a particular specialty spice.</p>\n<div class=\"article-callout\"><div class=\"callout-contents\"><p><span class=\"callout\">A critical step in setting prices is to ask what you want to optimize: profit, revenue, or some combination of them.</span></p>\n</div></div>\n<p>The variation in elasticities is also reflected in the perceived quality of the products. We found that imported baby-feeding bottles had lower average elasticities than domestically manufactured bottles, because the imported bottles were made by more-reputable manufacturers.</p>\n<p>This step will also allow you to understand which competitors&#8217; prices and stockouts had a more significant impact on your sales and hence require more monitoring and price matching. Not surprisingly, in our two initiatives, not all competitors had the same impact. Two of the four competitors tracked by the Chinese retailer had almost no impact on the company&#8217;s feeding-bottle sales. Two of the five competitors tracked by the U.S. retailer had twice the impact of the others.</p>\n<h2>5. Optimize</h2>\n<p>Now that you have populated your model with data, you are ready to find your best prices given competitors&#8217; prices and the other factors mentioned above. A critical first step is to ask what you want to optimize: profit, revenue, or some combination of the two. Growth-stage companies tend to focus more on revenue; mature companies focus more on profit.</p>\n<p>However, no retailer with whom we&#8217;ve worked or studied was ready to specify the relative weights they&#8217;d place on revenue versus profit. We have found that a better way to integrate these objectives is to use constrained optimization&#8212;that is, achieving the optimal goal within certain business constraints. For example, you might set your objective to maximize revenue without causing gross profit margins to fall below a specified level. When we worked with the Chinese retailer, it was selling feeding bottles at a 10% gross margin, on average. We optimized prices to maximize total revenue for the category while maintaining a categorical margin of at least 10%. Actual product margins after the optimization varied from -1% (sold at a slight loss) to 36%, depending on the item&#8217;s price elasticity. We matched the prices of the two primary competitors for products with high price elasticity; we typically did not price match with the two weakest competitors.</p>\n<p>In our effort with the U.S. retailer, we also optimized revenue subject to a constraint on profit margin. The retailer&#8217;s executives liked this approach because it kept their pricing consistent with the company&#8217;s strategic positioning but didn&#8217;t require additional decisions to be made, such as coming up with weights on profit and revenue. In both implementations, we incorporated other necessary business constraints (for example, price floors and ceilings or manufacturer-imposed price ranges) as part of the optimization.</p>\n<h2>6. Test and Implement</h2>\n<p>Before rolling out your new pricing algorithm, it is important to test it in a controlled experiment. Assign products to two groups: the treatment group, for which you will use the new pricing algorithm to set prices, and the control group, for which you will set prices the old way. The impact of the algorithm can then be measured by the results of the treatment group relative to those of the control group.</p>\n<p>You may ask: Is it really necessary to have a control group? Isn&#8217;t the impact simply the revenue increase produced by the new pricing algorithm? The problem is that you do not know what would have happened had you continued using the old method. In retailing, this &#8220;counterfactual&#8221; problem is amplified by the fact that most products tend to exhibit seasonality. For example, we bet that if you implemented your pricing algorithm in December and compared it against your sales in November, all price algorithms would generate triple-digit improvements. Having a control group allows you to tease out the impact of things that happen over time (holidays, promotions, new technology, new product releases) so that you can measure the real change produced by the new pricing algorithm.</p>\n<hbr-component type=\"newsletter\" name=\"Finance &#38; Economy\" />\n<p>A proper control group consists of products that are similar in characteristics and seasonality. In our implementation for the Chinese retailer, we assigned feeding bottles for children younger than six months to the treatment group and bottles for children older than six months to the control group. For the U.S. retailer, we assigned king and California king beds to the treatment group and queen, full, and twin beds to the control group. Moreover, we rotated the treatment and control groups. In the first week, king beds were the treatment group; the week after, queen beds were the treatment; and the third week, full and twin beds were the treatment. Such a rotation allows you to better ascertain the impact of the pricing model on revenue and filter out differences among various products.</p>\n<h2>7. Repeat Steps Three to Six for Continuous Improvement</h2>\n<p>Once you have successfully implemented a dynamic pricing system, we recommend that you update it periodically&#8212;every six months or whatever duration you deem necessary given your market dynamics. Be aware of major changes in your competitive landscape (new entrants, for example) and in the product portfolio (introduction of new products, for example) that may change consumers&#8217; choices and preferences. Repeat steps three through six (experiment, measure, optimize, and implement) to continually retune your algorithm.</p>\n<p>Our tool for setting prices dynamically is highly adaptable. You can easily incorporate new innovations into this analytics framework. You could, for example, introduce behavioral factors to better capture the consumers&#8217; decision-making process. In a research study at a grocery chain, we found that consumers don&#8217;t always fall for the longtime retailer convention of pricing a product at $X.99. While some consumers overweight the left digits of prices as much as 30%, others pay attention to the rightmost digits of a product&#8217;s price ($4.99 versus $5.00). This suggests that retailers need to be smart about when to incorporate this bias in their algorithms.</p>\n<p>Another way to adapt the tool is to integrate newly developed machine-learning algorithms to continually improve precision of price-elasticity estimates. Working with an international online retailer, we identified the products that each consumer viewed before making a purchase. This process enabled us to more accurately measure how the price of one product can affect the demand for similar products, subsequently boosting the retailer&#8217;s revenue by an additional 5%.</p>\n<h3>. . .</h3>\n<p>By weaving together data analysis, experimental methodologies, and a comprehensive understanding of consumer decision-making processes, retailers can generate significant increases in revenues while increasing or maintaining profit margins. The essence of the approach we have described is the complete cycle of &#8220;model, measure, maximize.&#8221; A piecemeal solution that involves only one of these steps may achieve minor improvements in revenues or profits of a percent here and there. But the integrated use of all three, powered by AI tools, will reward retailers with substantial improvements in revenues or profits that are sustainable over time.</p>",
