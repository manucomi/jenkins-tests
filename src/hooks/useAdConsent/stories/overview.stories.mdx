# useAdConsent Hook

A React hook that taps into Google's Funding Choices service to prompt consumers in the EU for
their consent to view ads. It expects that the Funding Choices script has been injected into your app.

To see the real modal in the Demo Story, add `?fc=alwaysshow` param in the url.

## Use example

```js
import useAdConsent from 'mfe-core/hooks/useAdConsent';

function App() {
    const adConsent = useAdConsent();

    return <>{adConsent && <AdSlot path="/34363400/HBR_970x90" />}</>;
}
```
