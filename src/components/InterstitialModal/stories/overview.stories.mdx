# InterstitialModal

The `InterstitialModal` component is a modal dialog that renders ads
from Google Ad Manager via Google Publish Tag library.

`Google Publisher Tag (GPT)` is an ad tag library that allows publishers
to define inventory, initiate and bundle ad requests, and render matching demand.
The `InterstitialModal` component requires the script to be loaded in order to function correctly.

## Props

The consumer app doesn't need to provide any props, the `InterstitialModal` defines two props that are used or testing purposes only,
and shouldn't be taken into account by the consumer.

## Loading GPT script example

Load the GPT library by adding the following to the `<head>` of the HTML document.

```html
<script src="//www.googletagservices.com/tag/js/gpt.js" async="async" />
```

## Use example

```jsx
import InterstitialModal from 'mfe-core/ui/InterstitialModal';

return <InterstitialModal />;
```
