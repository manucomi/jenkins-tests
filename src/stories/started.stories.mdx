# Getting Started

## Nexus configuration

`mfe-core` is hosted in our private Nexus registry. To install mfe-core you'll
need to authenticate with Nexus using a token. To generate this token you need
your Nexus credentials. Your Nexus credentials are different from the ones used
for Okta. You can verify your credentials by trying to log into the Nexus web
interface. If you do not have or do not know your Nexus credentials, reach out
to your manager or a DevOps engineer to help you.

Next, you can generate your authorization token in the terminal:

```bash
echo -n 'NEXUS_USER_NAME:NEXUS_PASSWORD' | openssl base64
```

With your newly generated token, go to your `.npmrc` file (**not** this project's)
located in ` ~/.npmrc` on your machine and update it as follows:

```
email=YOUR-HARVARD-EMAIL-HERE
strict-ssl=false
always-auth=true
//ae-qa-nexus-app01:8081/content/groups/npm-all/:_auth=YOUR-TOKEN-HERE
```

## Installation

To add the library to the dependencies:

```bash
//Latest published version
npm install mfe-core

//Or choose a version
npm install mfe-core@X.X.X

//Or get the latest code merged into main branch
npm install mfe-core@next
```
